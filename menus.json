you read the news today oh girl !
about a shop been close thanks to crisis
and all the news are rather boring.

But you need to subscribe to your new school
You just move in this new house with you mom

Wake up get of you bed,
get you stuff, brush you hair,
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

TODO: the text below is outdated and should be remove
You arrived in this bar with one vision, one purpose:
to get completely shitfaced and puke everywhere (you may have issues)

There are only two problems: one you're 1 month too young to get alcohol
and two you're broke since you gave all your money to the bouncer so he would let you in.

You will have to use your charisma and talk your way to booze but be wary
for bad words can get you bad consequences

Good luck and good drinks!

        How to play:

        left shift: show actionable items and exit points
        arrows: moving
        entrer and space: action (speak, take items...)
        esc,i,m,c,j: menu (open on diferent tab depending of key press)

        How to fight:

        When you piss someone else you will enter in battle mode

        Here you must defeat you enemy by lowering
        his HP to 0 while keeping above 0

        To do so you must use your two(2) attacks with maestria:

        Attack: Use it to attack your opponent

        Strong Attack: Use it to attack your opponent with
        more strength than a regular attack

        During your attack or the opposing one, a bar will
        appear on top of the screen

        This bar is divided in two or three parts of different
        colors: red, blue and dark blue

        When the cursor is in the red part, don't do anything
        or face the consequences

        When the cursor is in the blue part press space bar
        or enter key to make a combo or defend

        When the cursor is in the dark blue part hold the
        space bar or enter key for MASSIVE damage

        If you need some life back, find booze!

        Good luck
