Small RPG filled with pints and tavern brawls

# Download
Sometime I make a new release on itch: https://uso.itch.io/sukeban

Otherwise I have a Devlopement build here: https://github.com/cosmo-ray/Sukeban/releases/tag/latest (but it can be unstable)

Otherwise for glorious Arch user, ``` yay -Sy sukeban-git ``` should work.

# Goal
Game that might one day have 3 chapters
It will be a mix of RPG, Dating Sim, Delinquante's Gang management, and whatever contributor want

I don't want this RPG to be my RPG but an RPG made by a community
An RPG that no one could really know, because it will be in constant evolution.
So if you like this game, just a slightest, please, contribute :)
Yeap now you think I'm a f****** hipi, that true, but hey, it work for Arch Linux Kernel, it work for Arch Linux distro, It work for Wesnoth (on Arch), maybe it can work with this game too :)
