Best way is to come chat with us and ask what you want to do, or how to do something:

Otherwise, if you want to modify a map, you need [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
A lot of game data, are write in json, so if you want for examples modify a dialogue, the best is to modify it directly, and look how other dialogues do it.

The game code is mostly in lua.

The game engine is [here](https://github.com/cosmo-ray/yirl)
