## Character Specefic:

### Lemie

I need to have a diologue, on which, at some point you could slap Lemie, she would be angry and say "You hit me, even my father didn't hit me"

#### Bye Bye old love, you weren't enough for me.
when the game start, Lenie is the girlfriend of the most famous guy at shool, at some point this guy do shit, and won't be the most famous anymore.
thefore Lenie will dump her boyfriend to date the new most famous.
her old boyfriend won't be sad enough for her, and worst than that, he will find a new girlfriend and be somewhat to happy for her. she can't accept her old boyfirnd happyness, so will try to destroy him by any mean necesarry.
Player will either see some of what happen in cut-scene, and could maybe help her. player won't be able the prevent her plan,
as this quest will sevrve to present Lemie crazyness.

#### touch the twins
2 twin must be randmly generated, 1 must be love by everyone and the other a "looser", Lemie in one of her psycopath sceme, try to have the hated one murder his brother, and then push him to suicide.
the player could play the role of been a fake love pretender to the losser then date the loved one. maybe see some interation between the twins too, of course per will be able to prevent Lemie plan, and help her.

### Akira

When talk with relation > 9, he can invite you to hang with him,
this start a vn-scene screen, which should create relation.
that so I can start aligator 427 quest durring winter vacation.

### Ashley: 
Work Replacement quest:
Under certains conditions (yet to decide), she will ask you to replace her at work so she can go see her boyfriend. (she will pay you, a small part of her shift, and this will end you day)
After an undecided number of time, some peoples will look for her, and it might start new quets.
(angry ex/current boyfriend/girlfriend ?) (stalker ?) (peoples to who she own money ?)


## Under Town
Add under town, it's a mix of sewer with rats and shit, Catacombs with cults, scientifics bases. and old temples.

## other

add a character, that is a super stalker, and can stalk for you.
will be useful as a ingame way to debug characters AI. (maybe implement this in god mod first)
